        <p>MY name is  <b>Temilola Mustapha</b> and i'd love to express my passion and love for technology. 
            Honestly, my inspiration came from within me. 
            My passion and love for technology has always been something I have overlooked and now,
             I think is the chance to do something which not only I, but future generations will appreciate.
             I could learn things in the engineering side when I have free time. The knowledge I gain taking the courses Iâ€™ll need would be of benefit to me,
              and improve my knowledge vastly.</p>

        <h2>SECOND SECTION</h2>
        <p>I have learnt a whole lot in software Engineering, the HTML which provides the structure of a page and it was atually really interesting,
            and had a lot of fun learning it and the CSS which is the one i'm focused on at the moment and it is the <i><b>visual and</b></i>
            layout for a variety of devices. CSS is important becaause it adds more importance to a property/value than normal.

        <p> Below is the difference between <i><b>paddings, margins and borders:</b></i></p>
         <div> 
        <b>PADDINGS:</b>The inner space between the content and the border of your box.
        <br>
        <b>MARGINS:</b>The outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box.
        <br>
        <b>BORDERS: </b> The perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line.
